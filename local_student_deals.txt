Local student discount tables:
We have priority of students for each of the four stores.
We calculated which store maximum students have given Priority 1 and created a new table as final_discounts with each store name and discount as 20% for max(count(priority 1).
Store with the maximum count of priority 1 will have a discount of 20%, then the second top store will have a 15% discount and so on.

 
-- Create a temporary table to store the counts for each priority value
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE priority_counts AS
